# ZenML Features Testing

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to testing and exploring various features of ZenML. ZenML is a powerful open-source MLOps framework that simplifies the process of building, deploying, and managing machine learning pipelines. In this project, we will systematically test the following features:

## Features to be Tested

### Pipeline Creation and Management
- Creating basic and advanced pipelines
- Managing and scheduling pipeline runs

### Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
- Integrating different data sources
- Data validation and transformation

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Training models using various frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn)
- Evaluating model performance with different metrics

### Artifact and Metadata Tracking
- Tracking datasets, models, and metrics
- Using ZenML's metadata store

### Pipeline Orchestration
- Integrating with orchestrators like Kubeflow, Airflow, and Prefect
- Managing workflow dependencies

### Deployment and Monitoring
- Deploying models to different environments (e.g., local, cloud)
- Monitoring deployed models for performance and drift

### Integration with Other Tools
- Using ZenML with version control systems (e.g., Git)
- Integrating with experiment tracking tools (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases)
